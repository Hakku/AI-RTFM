# AI-RTFM Progress
> Last updated: 2026-02-07 (session 8)

## COMPLETED
- Phase 1 (Hardening): path fixes, English conversion, kernel simplification, dependent file updates (2026-01-29)
- Phase 2 (Discoverability): tag taxonomy, llms.txt, search/stale tools, 6 missing templates, #concept kernel, review cycle standardization, date fixes, llms.txt corrections (2026-01-30, 2026-02-04)
- Standards translated to English (documentation-guide, review-process, style-guide) (2026-02-04)
- Pushed to GitHub Hakku/AI-RTFM (2026-02-04)
- Workflow migration: replaced context.md/memory.md/.learnings/ with canonical docs + session files (2026-02-04)
- Repo made public, GitHub ruleset active on main: restrict deletions, block force pushes, require PR (2026-02-04)
- CLAUDE.md restored: Two-Layer Architecture section, Workflow Patterns (Claude Code features) (2026-02-04)
- Cleaned up test-ruleset.tmp leftover file (2026-02-04)
- JTBD scoping session: reframed job to "write docs you're not embarrassed by, fast" (2026-02-05) — SUPERSEDED
- Fresh-eyes codebase audit: full read of every file, produced honest assessment of what exists (2026-02-06)
- **Phase 1 context re-alignment:** PRD rewritten (three-component framing, new roadmap, known issues, creator context, working rules), IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN roadmap replaced, README/llms.txt/TECH_STACK/CLAUDE.md updated to match context package (2026-02-06)
- **Phase 2 workflow re-alignment (2026-02-06):**
  - Created `.claude/rules/` with 5 modular rule files (workflow, communication, documentation-conventions, safety, completion-checklist) — extracted from monolithic CLAUDE.md and adapted from workflow-docs/system-prompt.md
  - Slimmed CLAUDE.md from 168 lines to 87 lines — essentials only, detailed rules in .claude/rules/
  - Created `.claude/skills/interrogation/SKILL.md` — adapted from workflow-docs/part-1-prompt.md, invokable via /interrogation
  - Created `.claude/skills/doc-generation/SKILL.md` — adapted from workflow-docs/part-2-prompt.md, invokable via /doc-generation
  - Updated SESSION-BRIEF-INTERROGATION.md — refreshed for current state, added app-phase questions, references skills
  - Archived SESSION-BRIEF-JTBD.md to .backup/ (superseded)
  - Updated APP_FLOW.md — marked application flows as pending interrogation

## IN PROGRESS
- **Interrogation phase** — next step: run /interrogation skill to answer open questions in SESSION-BRIEF-INTERROGATION.md
- Created WORKFLOW.md — developer/contributor guide for working on AI-RTFM with Claude Code (2026-02-07)
- **Architecture review complete (2026-02-07):** Full system review — every file read, cross-references checked, architecture assessed. Findings integrated into SESSION-BRIEF-INTERROGATION.md for interrogation phase. Key findings: kernels too thin (~15 lines, no examples), tools blind to 8/12 content dirs, template-kernel-example triangle disconnected, hashtag activation fragile, 5 broken cross-refs in examples, placeholder dates in standards
- **Best practices fixes (2026-02-07, PR #15):** Added MIT LICENSE, SECURITY.md, fixed placeholder dates in 3 standards files, removed 5 broken links from deploy-to-production.md, set GitHub repo description + topics
- **Best practices fixes batch 2 (2026-02-07, PR #17):** Expanded tool search dirs (4→15 content dirs), renamed incident file (2024→2026 date), added frontmatter to 4 project docs, fixed phantom script reference in review-process.md, fixed llms.txt incident filename

## NEXT
- **START HERE:** Run `/interrogation` skill with SESSION-BRIEF-INTERROGATION.md
- After interrogation: run `/doc-generation` to produce/update canonical docs
- Phase 3 verification pass
- Begin prompt redesign (roadmap phase 1)

## KNOWN ISSUES
- **Prompts are weak** — PRISM Kernels need proper redesign (HIGH — this is the next real work)
- ~~**Tools blind to 8/12 doc types** — search.ps1 and stale-finder.ps1 hardcode 4 directories (runbooks, incidents, adr, kb). Docs in api, change, onboard, security, compliance, iac, dr, concept directories are invisible (MED)~~ FIXED PR #17
- ~~**Broken cross-references in examples** — deploy-to-production.md links to 5 non-existent files (MED)~~ FIXED PR #15
- ~~**Placeholder dates in standards** — style-guide.md and review-process.md have `YYYY-MM-DD` instead of real dates (MED)~~ FIXED PR #15
- ~~**llms.txt filename bug** — links to `2024-10-15-database-outage.md` but document describes 2026 event (LOW)~~ FIXED PR #17
- **Tag taxonomy has fictional systems** — order-service, payment-service etc. are from examples, not real infra (LOW)
- No rendered docs site (raw markdown only) — LOW
- Templates lack co-located writing guides (Good Docs Project pattern) — LOW
- ~~review-process.md references non-existent `./scripts/validate-frontmatter.sh`~~ FIXED PR #17 (replaced with TODO note)

## DECISIONS
- **Phase 2 workflow re-alignment (2026-02-06):** Adopted Claude Code v2 `.claude/rules/` for modular rules (Anthropic warns bloated CLAUDE.md gets ignored). Created reusable skills for interrogation and doc-generation. Rejected "no file overwrites" rule (git handles versioning). Rejected tasks/todo.md (Claude Code built-in TaskCreate is better). Adapted IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN immutability (immutable within phase, revisable between). Phase 4+ rules noted but not active.
- **Context package received (2026-02-06):** Definitive project identity from creator. AI-RTFM = documentation toolkit (three components: folder structure + templates, AI prompts, process layer). Direction is tightening, not expanding
- **New roadmap (2026-02-06):** 1) Redesign PRISM prompts, 2) Build prompt generator UI, 3) Model-agnostic/versioned prompts, 4) Self-improving prompt library → production app at Luhta. Old roadmap (validation scripts, CI/CD, RAG, MCP) is retired
- **Prompts assessed as weak (2026-02-06):** User assessment overrides agent analysis. Prompt redesign is the highest priority
- **10-minute user (2026-02-06):** Time target tightened from 30 min to 10 min. Every feature must justify itself against "does this help someone with 10 minutes?"
- **Production app on roadmap (2026-02-06):** "Application UI/frontend" removed from Out of Scope — it's on the new roadmap
- **HALT: Interrogation required before continuing.** JTBD session produced a job definition, but proposed solutions were rejected as "not comprehensive enough" and "not meeting needs." Root cause: we don't actually know what AI-RTFM IS. Building must stop until interrogation is complete (2026-02-05)
- **Fresh-eyes audit findings (2026-02-06):** Product is ~30 deliverable files (kernels, templates, examples, standards, training, tools). Meta/project-management layer is disproportionate (~25 files managing a content package as if it were software). PRISM methodology and training materials are the strongest parts. Identity crisis confirmed: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN has software engineering phases for a non-software product
- **JTBD reframe (SUPERSEDED):** Job was defined as "write docs you're not embarrassed by, fast" — but this may be incomplete. Interrogation will validate or revise (2026-02-05)
- Language: English (system), Finnish (outputs), multi-language future (2026-01-29)
- Scope: Team resource -> company-wide (2026-01-29)
- Audience: IT Operations, expanding later (2026-01-29)
- Kernels: Version-controlled, shared (2026-01-29)
- Two-layer architecture: Project mgmt separate from doc system (2026-01-29)
- Kernel simplification: Executed — plain English format (2026-01-29)
- Repo visibility: public (enables free-tier ruleset enforcement) (2026-02-04)
- Branch protection: ruleset on main — require PR, restrict deletions, block force pushes (2026-02-04)

## OPEN QUESTIONS
- How should prompt redesign be structured? (interrogation will answer)
- What does "good output" look like for each kernel type? (interrogation will answer)
- What does the Prompt Generator UI do specifically? (interrogation will answer)
- What's the tech stack for the application? (interrogation will answer)
- Should kernels be split into per-type directories with co-located examples? (interrogation)
- Should kernels be composable (base + type + audience + language)? (interrogation)
- Should review cycles be tiered by document criticality? (interrogation)
- What platforms must kernels work with? (interrogation)
