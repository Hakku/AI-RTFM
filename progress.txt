# AI-RTFM Progress
> Last updated: 2026-02-06 (session 6)

## COMPLETED
- Phase 1 (Hardening): path fixes, English conversion, kernel simplification, dependent file updates (2026-01-29)
- Phase 2 (Discoverability): tag taxonomy, llms.txt, search/stale tools, 6 missing templates, #concept kernel, review cycle standardization, date fixes, llms.txt corrections (2026-01-30, 2026-02-04)
- Standards translated to English (documentation-guide, review-process, style-guide) (2026-02-04)
- Pushed to GitHub Hakku/AI-RTFM (2026-02-04)
- Workflow migration: replaced context.md/memory.md/.learnings/ with canonical docs + session files (2026-02-04)
- Repo made public, GitHub ruleset active on main: restrict deletions, block force pushes, require PR (2026-02-04)
- CLAUDE.md restored: Two-Layer Architecture section, Workflow Patterns (Claude Code features) (2026-02-04)
- Cleaned up test-ruleset.tmp leftover file (2026-02-04)
- JTBD scoping session: reframed job to "write docs you're not embarrassed by, fast" (2026-02-05) — SUPERSEDED
- Fresh-eyes codebase audit: full read of every file, produced honest assessment of what exists (2026-02-06)
- **Phase 1 context re-alignment:** PRD rewritten (three-component framing, new roadmap, known issues, creator context, working rules), IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN roadmap replaced, README/llms.txt/TECH_STACK/CLAUDE.md updated to match context package (2026-02-06)

## IN PROGRESS
- **Phase 2 workflow re-alignment** — APP_FLOW, session briefs, process files (NOT training materials). User is preparing scope — next session

## NEXT
- **START HERE:** User will define Phase 2 scope (training materials explicitly excluded)
- Phase 2 workflow re-alignment
- Phase 3 verification pass
- Begin interrogation phase for prompt redesign

## KNOWN ISSUES
- **Prompts are weak** — PRISM Kernels need proper redesign (HIGH — this is the next real work)
- No rendered docs site (raw markdown only) — LOW
- Templates lack co-located writing guides (Good Docs Project pattern) — LOW

## DECISIONS
- **Context package received (2026-02-06):** Definitive project identity from creator. AI-RTFM = documentation toolkit (three components: folder structure + templates, AI prompts, process layer). Direction is tightening, not expanding
- **New roadmap (2026-02-06):** 1) Redesign PRISM prompts, 2) Build prompt generator UI, 3) Model-agnostic/versioned prompts, 4) Self-improving prompt library → production app at Luhta. Old roadmap (validation scripts, CI/CD, RAG, MCP) is retired
- **Prompts assessed as weak (2026-02-06):** User assessment overrides agent analysis. Prompt redesign is the highest priority
- **10-minute user (2026-02-06):** Time target tightened from 30 min to 10 min. Every feature must justify itself against "does this help someone with 10 minutes?"
- **Production app on roadmap (2026-02-06):** "Application UI/frontend" removed from Out of Scope — it's on the new roadmap
- **HALT: Interrogation required before continuing.** JTBD session produced a job definition, but proposed solutions were rejected as "not comprehensive enough" and "not meeting needs." Root cause: we don't actually know what AI-RTFM IS. Building must stop until interrogation is complete (2026-02-05)
- **Fresh-eyes audit findings (2026-02-06):** Product is ~30 deliverable files (kernels, templates, examples, standards, training, tools). Meta/project-management layer is disproportionate (~25 files managing a content package as if it were software). PRISM methodology and training materials are the strongest parts. Identity crisis confirmed: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN has software engineering phases for a non-software product
- **JTBD reframe (SUPERSEDED):** Job was defined as "write docs you're not embarrassed by, fast" — but this may be incomplete. Interrogation will validate or revise (2026-02-05)
- Language: English (system), Finnish (outputs), multi-language future (2026-01-29)
- Scope: Team resource -> company-wide (2026-01-29)
- Audience: IT Operations, expanding later (2026-01-29)
- Kernels: Version-controlled, shared (2026-01-29)
- Two-layer architecture: Project mgmt separate from doc system (2026-01-29)
- Kernel simplification: Executed — plain English format (2026-01-29)
- Repo visibility: public (enables free-tier ruleset enforcement) (2026-02-04)
- Branch protection: ruleset on main — require PR, restrict deletions, block force pushes (2026-02-04)

## OPEN QUESTIONS
- How should prompt redesign be structured? (interrogation will answer)
- What does "good output" look like for each kernel type? (interrogation will answer)
