# AI-RTFM Progress
> Last updated: 2026-02-06 (session 5)

## COMPLETED
- Phase 1 (Hardening): path fixes, English conversion, kernel simplification, dependent file updates (2026-01-29)
- Phase 2 (Discoverability): tag taxonomy, llms.txt, search/stale tools, 6 missing templates, #concept kernel, review cycle standardization, date fixes, llms.txt corrections (2026-01-30, 2026-02-04)
- Standards translated to English (documentation-guide, review-process, style-guide) (2026-02-04)
- Pushed to GitHub Hakku/AI-RTFM (2026-02-04)
- Workflow migration: replaced context.md/memory.md/.learnings/ with canonical docs + session files (2026-02-04)
- Repo made public, GitHub ruleset active on main: restrict deletions, block force pushes, require PR (2026-02-04)
- CLAUDE.md restored: Two-Layer Architecture section, Workflow Patterns (Claude Code features) (2026-02-04)
- Cleaned up test-ruleset.tmp leftover file (2026-02-04)
- JTBD scoping session: reframed job to "write docs you're not embarrassed by, fast" (2026-02-05) — SUPERSEDED
- Fresh-eyes codebase audit: full read of every file, produced honest assessment of what exists (2026-02-06)

## IN PROGRESS
- **INTERROGATION:** Fundamental re-scoping of what AI-RTFM is (see SESSION-BRIEF-INTERROGATION.md)
- User has additional context about the interrogation system and broader scope — will continue next session

## NEXT
- **START HERE:** User will share more about the interrogation system and full scope vision
- After that: complete interrogation, redefine AI-RTFM, update canonical docs
- Phase 3 work is ON HOLD until interrogation completes

## KNOWN ISSUES
- No prompt versioning metadata on kernels (version, last-tested-model) — LOW
- No rendered docs site (raw markdown only) — LOW
- Templates lack co-located writing guides (Good Docs Project pattern) — LOW

## DECISIONS
- **HALT: Interrogation required before continuing.** JTBD session produced a job definition, but proposed solutions were rejected as "not comprehensive enough" and "not meeting needs." Root cause: we don't actually know what AI-RTFM IS. Building must stop until interrogation is complete (2026-02-05)
- **Fresh-eyes audit findings (2026-02-06):** Product is ~30 deliverable files (kernels, templates, examples, standards, training, tools). Meta/project-management layer is disproportionate (~25 files managing a content package as if it were software). PRISM methodology and training materials are the strongest parts. Identity crisis confirmed: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN has software engineering phases for a non-software product
- **JTBD reframe (SUPERSEDED):** Job was defined as "write docs you're not embarrassed by, fast" — but this may be incomplete. Interrogation will validate or revise (2026-02-05)
- Language: English (system), Finnish (outputs), multi-language future (2026-01-29)
- Scope: Team resource → company-wide (2026-01-29)
- Audience: IT Operations, expanding later (2026-01-29)
- Kernels: Version-controlled, shared (2026-01-29)
- Two-layer architecture: Project mgmt separate from doc system (2026-01-29)
- Kernel simplification: Executed — plain English format (2026-01-29)
- Validation tooling: PowerShell, full checks (frontmatter, lint, links, style, stale) (2026-02-04)
- Validation severity: FAIL: frontmatter/internal links/>400 lines. WARN: style/external links/tags (2026-02-04)
- CI/CD platform: Deferred — not ready yet (2026-02-04)
- Prompt library: Full (review, maintenance, analysis) in kernels/ subdirectories (2026-02-04)
- RAG preparation: All documentation, full semantic frontmatter enrichment (2026-02-04)
- MCP: Phase 4 scope (2026-02-04)
- Doc size limit: Strict max ~400 lines (2026-02-04)
- Ownership model: Team-based (@team-name format) (2026-02-04)
- Frontmatter enrichment: audience, complexity, dependencies, keywords, summary, language (2026-02-04)
- Framework review cycle: On change only, not scheduled (2026-02-04)
- Company-wide governance: Too early — IT Ops adoption first (2026-02-04)
- Review cycles: 30 days for active ops docs; incident=once, ADR=on-change, change=lifecycle (2026-02-04)
- Concept doc type: #concept kernel + concept-template.md (2026-02-04)
- Repo visibility: public (enables free-tier ruleset enforcement) (2026-02-04)
- Branch protection: ruleset on main — require PR, restrict deletions, block force pushes (2026-02-04)

## OPEN QUESTIONS
- Content reuse mechanism? (DITA pattern — includes/snippets for shared content)
- Rendered docs site? (Stripe/Twilio pattern — currently raw markdown only)
- Is AI-RTFM a starter kit that's essentially done, or the foundation for something bigger? Fresh-eyes audit surfaced this as the core question (2026-02-06)
