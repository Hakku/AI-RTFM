- Workflow migration: replaced context.md/memory.md/.learnings/ with canonical docs + session files (2026-02-04)
- Repo made public, GitHub ruleset active on main: restrict deletions, block force pushes, require PR (2026-02-04)

## IN PROGRESS
- (none)

## NEXT
- **START HERE:** Read SESSION-BRIEF-JTBD.md and execute JTBD scoping session
- After scoping: Phase 3, step 3.1: Build frontmatter validation script (PowerShell)

## KNOWN ISSUES
- No prompt versioning metadata on kernels (version, last-tested-model) — LOW
- No rendered docs site (raw markdown only) — LOW
- Templates lack co-located writing guides (Good Docs Project pattern) — LOW

## DECISIONS
- Language: English (system), Finnish (outputs), multi-language future (2026-01-29)
- Scope: Team resource → company-wide (2026-01-29)
- Audience: IT Operations, expanding later (2026-01-29)
- Kernels: Version-controlled, shared (2026-01-29)
- Two-layer architecture: Project mgmt separate from doc system (2026-01-29)
- Kernel simplification: Executed — plain English format (2026-01-29)
- Validation tooling: PowerShell, full checks (frontmatter, lint, links, style, stale) (2026-02-04)
- Validation severity: FAIL: frontmatter/internal links/>400 lines. WARN: style/external links/tags (2026-02-04)
- CI/CD platform: Deferred — not ready yet (2026-02-04)
- Prompt library: Full (review, maintenance, analysis) in kernels/ subdirectories (2026-02-04)
- RAG preparation: All documentation, full semantic frontmatter enrichment (2026-02-04)
- MCP: Phase 4 scope (2026-02-04)
- Doc size limit: Strict max ~400 lines (2026-02-04)
- Ownership model: Team-based (@team-name format) (2026-02-04)
- Frontmatter enrichment: audience, complexity, dependencies, keywords, summary, language (2026-02-04)
- Framework review cycle: On change only, not scheduled (2026-02-04)
- Company-wide governance: Too early — IT Ops adoption first (2026-02-04)
- Review cycles: 30 days for active ops docs; incident=once, ADR=on-change, change=lifecycle (2026-02-04)
- Concept doc type: #concept kernel + concept-template.md (2026-02-04)
- Repo visibility: public (enables free-tier ruleset enforcement) (2026-02-04)
- Branch protection: ruleset on main — require PR, restrict deletions, block force pushes (2026-02-04)

## OPEN QUESTIONS
- Content reuse mechanism? (DITA pattern — includes/snippets for shared content)
- Rendered docs site? (Stripe/Twilio pattern — currently raw markdown only)
